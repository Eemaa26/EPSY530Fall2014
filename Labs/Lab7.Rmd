#### 1. Choose another traditional variable from mlb11 that you think might be a good predictor of runs. Produce a scatterplot of the two variables and fit a linear model. At a glance, does there seem to be a linear relationship?



#### 2. How does this relationship compare to the relationship between runs and at bats? Use the R2 values from the two model summaries to compare. Does your variable seem to predict runs better than at bats? How can you tell?



#### 3. Now that you can summarize the linear relationship between two variables, investigate the relation- ships between runs and each of the other five traditional variables. Which variable best predicts runs? Support your conclusion using the graphical and numerical methods we’ve discussed (for the sake of conciseness, only include output for the best variable, not all five).




#### 4. Now examine the three newer variables. These are the statistics used by the author of Moneyball to predict a teams success. In general, are they more or less effective at predicting runs that the old variables? Explain using appropriate graphical and numerical evidence. Of all ten variables we’ve analyzed, which seems to be the best predictor of runs? Using the limited (or not so limited) information you know about these baseball statistics, does your result make sense?



#### 5. Check the model diagnostics for the regression model with the variable you decided was the best predictor for runs.



### 6. What concepts from the textbook are covered in this lab? What concepts, if any, are not covered in the textbook? Have you seen these concepts elsewhere, e.g. lecture, discussion section, previous labs, or homework problems? Be specific in your answer.
