#### 1. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average length of pregnancies (weeks) and interpret it in context. Note that since youâ€™re doing inference on a single population parameter, there is no explanatory variable, so you can omit the x variable from the function.


#### 2. Calculate a new confidence interval for the same parameter at the 90% confidence level. You can change the confidence level by adding a new argument to the function: conflevel =0.90.



#### 3. Conduct a hypothesis test evaluating whether the average weight gained by younger mothers is different than the average weight gained by mature mothers.



#### 4. Now, a non-inference task: Determine the age cutoff for younger and mature mothers. Use a method of your choice, and explain how your method works.



#### 5. Pick a pair of numerical and categorical variables and come up with a research question evaluating the relationship between these variables. Formulate the question in a way that it can be answered using a hypothesis test and/or a confidence interval. Answer your question using the inference function, report the statistical results, and also provide an explanation in plain language.



#### 6. What concepts from the textbook are covered in this lab? What concepts, if any, are not covered in the textbook? Have you seen these concepts elsewhere, e.g. lecture, discussion section, previous labs, or homework problems? Be specific in your answer.
